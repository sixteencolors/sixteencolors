	<h2 class=heading><span>Developer API</span></h2>

	<p>We have created a simple API for developers to use Sixteen Colors data within their applications. The data provided by the API
	will expand as the data contained within the site expands. Currently there are four methods within the API</p>

	<h3>Years</h3>
	<p>The starting point for Sixteen Colors data is a year. The data that is returned is a simple array of years.</p>
	<blockquote class="code">http://sixteencolors.net/api/pack</blockquote>
	<h4>Sample data:</h4>
	<blockquote class="code">{"years":[2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003,2002,2001,2000,1999,1998,1997,1996,1995,1994,1993]}</blockquote>

	<h3>Packs in Year</h3>
	<blockquote class="code">http://sixteencolors.net/api/pack?year=[year]</blockquote>
	<p>Each pack in the year will be returned. The data for each year is:</p>
    <dl>
		<dt>filename</dt>
		<dd>The filename of the pack</dd>
		<dt>month</dt>
		<dd>The month the pack was released. May be null.</dd>
		<dt>year</dt>
		<dd>The year the pack was released</dd>
		<dt>name</dt>
		<dd>The canonical name of the pack</dd>
	</dl>
	<h4>Sample data:</h4>
	<blockquote class="code">{"packs":[{"filename":"legion01.zip","month":null,"name":"legion01","year":1998},{"filename":"legion02.zip","month":null,"name":"legion02","year":1998},{"filename":"legion03.zip","month":null,"name":"legion03","year":1998},{"filename":"legion04.zip","month":null,"name":"legion04","year":1998}]}</blockquote>
